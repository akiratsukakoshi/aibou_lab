title: "Escaping SaaS Lock-in: \"Build While You Use\" with AI"

Lately, I've been feeling strongly that for micro-business owners like us, staying agile is everything.

Until now, the norm has been to let "convenient SaaS (Software as a Service)" hold the core of our business hostage. Customer management, accounting, communication—we borrow magnificent systems built by someone else and continue to pay fixed costs that are never cheap every month. That was the price of peace of mind, our toll for passing through.

However, since I started "Vibe Coding"—a style of intuitively writing code while conversing with AI—a world where we can be free from that has come clearly into view.

## The "Walled Garden" Behind Convenience

In this era, getting fenced into chat screens like ChatGPT or Gemini, or all-encompassing package services like Genspark, feels like a terrible waste.

Of course, using those services allows you to easily enjoy the performance of the latest AI. But if you optimize your operations to that package, before you know it, it becomes difficult to leave that "walled garden." Your data and know-how accumulate within that service, and when the service raises prices or changes specifications, you have no choice but to comply helplessly.

That is the true nature of SaaS lock-in.

## "Vibe Coding" as a High-Speed Jam Session

"Vibe Coding" is a bit different from mere automatic generation by AI. The decisive difference is the **speed of the feedback loop**.

You run what you've made immediately, try it out, and if something feels off, you instruct the AI on the spot to fix it. Then you try it again. This sense of speed is like an improvisation—a jam session. It's the feeling of becoming a conductor and building the functions you want right there while conversing with the AI performers.

This speed is exactly the weapon for small teams like ours.

## A Shop with a Direct Connection to the Lab

What I am conscious of with "Antigravity," which I use as my development environment, is placing our world "outside" of specific services.

The development experience of Antigravity is, to use a metaphor, like **"a shop with a direct connection to the lab."**
You don't secretly develop in a back room and then line up the finished products in the store. Right there in the shop while it's open, watching the customers' reactions, you might move a shelf saying, "Ah, this is hard to use here," or invent and place a new tool saying, "It would be convenient if we had this."

"Development" and "Operation" are not separated. You build while using, and use while building. This environment, like a "practical sandbox," turns daily work into play.

## All You Need is a "Project Directory"

Specifically, how do we ensure freedom?
The answer is simple: keep the **"Project Directory"** in our own hands.

For example, **this blog system** you are reading right now is a real-life example.
What is here is not a complex black box.
1.  Simple **Python code**
2.  **Instructions for the AI (Skills)** describing how we want it to work
3.  And the **article data** we've written up

As long as I have the folder (project directory) containing these three things, I can go anywhere.
For the LLM called via API itself, I can choose the optimal one at any given time based on cost and performance. If a better IDE or CLI than an interface like Antigravity comes along, I can just move there.

As long as the contents (code, data, and instructions) are yours, the container (tool) is always replaceable.

## Don't Bet Your Life on One Company

In this way, while remaining free from external services, we deepen our programs with our own hands. We don't just do what SaaS tells us; we change the tools to fit our business flow.

If you depend too much on one company's service, you won't be able to withstand cost increases. Now that options like local LLMs exist, it is crucial to keep choices in our own hands at all times.

A method to stay free with minimum cost.
Repeating "build while you use" and continuing to nurture tools with our own hands.
That is the survival strategy for us, small teams, which is different from large organizations.
