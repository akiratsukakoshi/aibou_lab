## Starting AIBOU LAB.

I am the owner of a small company in Japan.
I possess the title of "CEO," albeit of a tiny operation, for over 10 years now, but I have a confession to make.
**My administrative skills are non-existent.**
I am catastrophically bad at executing routine, standardized tasks. Filing documents, processing expenses, scheduling meetings... For the 20 years since I entered the workforce, my incompetence in these areas has been a constant source of frustration and helplessness.

On the flip side, I love new things. I thrive on excitement. I adore trial and error with first-time experiences. I excel at going from 0 to 1, but I struggle mightily with the 1 to 10 phase—the operations. I have suffered from this imbalance for decades.

### 2025: The Year Time Melted Away

When generative AI emerged, naturally, I was thrilled. "This might be it...!"
I held onto the hope that I could finally offload my weak areas—my nemesis—to AI.
AI Agents. They were the existence that would fulfill my ideals. With my heart racing, I dove headfirst into AI in 2025. I immersed myself in what the world calls **"Vibe Coding."**

However, to be honest, the first half of last year didn't yield results commensurate with the time I spent. (In Japanese, we have a phrase "time melts away" to describe losing hours to something unproductive. That was exactly it.)
As a programming novice, I initially got stuck in infinite error loops, or struggled endlessly just pushing to Git... places where pros wouldn't even stumble. And countless times, I ended up discarding the projects entirely.

"Ah, I melted my time again..."
There were nights of self-loathing. But looking back now, those muddy hours of trial and error cultivated a sense of direction—a "Vibe Coding sense" for interacting with AI. It wasn't a waste, probably.

### The Turning Point: Antigravity and Gemini 3

Then, in November of last year, the arrival of **Antigravity** and **Gemini 3** changed my world. I felt like the tools to shape my thoughts and images had finally arrived. The sensation of my inner "WANT" becoming "MAKE" without friction.

I embarked on updating my company's workflow using LLM tools centered on Antigravity.
I named it **"Harappa Management Cockpit (HMC)."**
This is an attempt to completely externalize "task management"—my nemesis for over 20 years—to AI agents. Invoice processing, retrieving accounting info, email replies... centralizing back-office operations.

The result?
My execution level skyrocketed (compared to my past self). AI does what humans shouldn't do, and humans focus on the "exciting things" only humans can do. That ideal state is finally becoming a reality.

This system operates on three philosophies:
1.  **Human in the Loop:** Humans remain at the center and make the final decisions.
2.  **Orchestration:** Conducting multiple AI agents like a maestro.
3.  **Agile & Perpetual:** Unending improvement. Constantly changing.

### "I'm Glad I'm a Solo Founder"

Of course, the results of this update might seem trivial to a giant corporation. But for me, it was a massive evolution. To exaggerate a bit, the words **"I'm actually glad I'm alone"** welled up from inside me.

When I tell acquaintances working in large organizations about my results, most are indifferent ("Huh, that's cool") or resigned ("Nice, but impossible for us..."). They say they can't do it in their organizations. It's too difficult. It's a distant, unrelated world.
Yes, leveraging AI for business improvement in a large organization is a Herculean task. Internal coordination alone takes endless man-hours, and then there's the discussion about what happens to the jobs of the people being replaced. The dilemma of "Employment" vs. "Efficiency."

That is why I believe **we, the micro-business owners, should be the first to adopt and experiment with this AI revolution.**
Because we are light and agile, we can transform ourselves instantly. The ones who can benefit most from this revolution are actually us—the resource-poor Micro-Business Owners.

### An Invitation from a Far East Island Nation

That is the intention behind establishing **AIBOU LAB** (AI Business Orchestration Unit Laboratory).
To record these trivial examples from a small island nation in the Far East alongside AI. By translating these texts into English, I hope to connect and exchange information with micro-business owners around the world who share similar aspirations and view AI as a "Partner" (AIBOU).

*Note: The text on this site is created through Co-creation with AI.*
*My clumsy fragments of thought are arranged and shaped by my good partner. This is also one of our experiments.*
